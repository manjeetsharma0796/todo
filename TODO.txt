  ---------
  feedback
  1. Pulling out functions into at the very start and reusablity isn't used , so why not inline
  2. 


  -----------------
  for 6th requirement

  1. create sort alphabetical button in html and commit
  2. add handler onclick what will happen
    pseudocode

    sortAlphabetical.onclick =() => {
      removeAllChild from todoListContainer
      sort the taskData
      taskData.forEach((task) => {
        createElement
        append;
      });
    };



tasks = [{name: 'this', taskCompleted: false},
{name: 'this is again', taskCompleted: false}, 
{name: 'aloo', taskCompleted: false}]

for sorting
tasks.toSorted((task1, task2) => task1.name < task2.name ? -1 : 1);
